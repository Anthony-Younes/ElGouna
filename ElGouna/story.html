                Founder of El Gouna</span><br>
                How it all started
                In the late '80s, my family and I stumbled upon an untouched stretch of Egypt's Red Sea coast. Inspired by its beauty, I imagined a sustainable resort town coexisting harmoniously with nature. In 1989, we embarked on the journey of creating El Gouna. It began with a commitment to eco-friendly development and unique architecture, forming the foundations of a thriving community.
                Over the years, El Gouna has blossomed into a vibrant, award-winning destination, offering pristine beaches, world-class resorts, and a rich cultural scene. Today, it is a testament to our dedication to preserving the environment while providing a high-quality lifestyle. El Gouna is not just a resort; it's living proof of the power of vision, sustainability, and a deep love for the Red Sea.</span></Construction></p>
